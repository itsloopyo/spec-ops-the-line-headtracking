:: Spec Ops: The Line Head Tracking - Uninstall
:: ============================================
:: Thin wrapper - uninstall body lives in cameraunlock-core/scripts/uninstall-body.cmd,
:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: uninstall behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper. Everything below the
:: CONFIG BLOCK is copied verbatim from
:: cameraunlock-core/scripts/templates/uninstall-wrapper.cmd.

set "ASSEMBLY_DLL="
:: MonoCecil: marker the patcher injects; guards against capturing/restoring a
:: patched Assembly-CSharp.dll as the pristine .original backup.
set "PATCH_MARKER="
:: MonoCecil: extra files to also remove from MANAGED_SUBFOLDER (config/log
:: files left behind by the mod itself).
set "MANAGED_EXTRAS="
:: ASILoader: filename the ASI DLL was renamed to. Defaults to winmm.dll.
set "ASI_LOADER_NAME=dinput8.dll"
:: ASILoader: subdirectory below the exe directory the payload went into. MUST
:: match install.cmd's value, or uninstall looks in the wrong folder.
set "ASI_SUBDIR="
:: UE4SS: path under GAME_PATH holding the shipping exe. MUST match
:: install.cmd's value.

:: Pin delayed expansion off before `%*` is expanded on the `call` below.
:: Under `cmd /V:ON`, or with DelayedExpansion=1 in
:: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor, cmd.exe eats a `!` out of the
:: expanded line, and a real game path like C:\Games\Oh! My Game reaches the
:: body already mangled. The body pins expansion off at its own outer scope
:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
