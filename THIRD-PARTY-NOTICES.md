# Third-Party Notices

SpecOpsTheLineHeadTracking bundles, statically links, or credits the third-party components
listed below. Each remains the property of its authors and is used under its own
licence. Where a licence requires the copyright notice, the conditions and the
disclaimer to accompany a binary distribution, the full text is reproduced here
verbatim, and this file ships at the root of every release ZIP we publish.

The mod's own source, everything under `src/`, is MIT licensed by itsloopyo;
its text is in `LICENSE` at the repository root and at the root of every
release ZIP. Nothing in this repository is derived from Spec Ops: The Line, and
none of its game code, extracted assets or data files is redistributed here or
in either release ZIP. The README embeds a gameplay clip from
`assets/readme-clip.gif`, and that file is not in the tree today, so no footage
of the game is redistributed here either. The section at the end of this file
sets out the terms the clip is kept under and applies from the moment it lands.

## Ultimate ASI Loader

Vendored at `vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/`, shipped in the installer ZIP and used as the
install-time source; the upstream licence file ships beside it at
`vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/LICENSE`. The binary is modified: see "Embedded
third-party DLLs removed" at the end of this section.

- **Version:** `v9.7.4` (commit `6b440669144c4a0bef5718ab155df160d231cd42`)
- **License:** MIT
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader
- **Usage:** Installed as the `dinput8.dll` proxy in the game's `Binaries/Win32/`
  directory, which is what loads `SpecOpsTheLineHeadTracking.asi`.
- **Bundled:** yes. Shipped in the release ZIP and copied from there by `install.cmd`;
  the installer never fetches it over the network.
- **Upstream asset SHA-256:** `d5a059aa467a7a7127c8f6169f79fa63ff0f55986ee9eb2fd9a281bebf2aa2e6`
- **dinput8.dll SHA-256:** `98a454c2abbab1d278b580d9fca31b28818980b1044fa091263a2add791e2ecf`
  (the vendored copy, after the strip described below - this is the binary the
  installer ZIP carries)

```

That `dinput8.dll` is a static binary and is not one component. The
`Ultimate-ASI-Loader-Win32` target in `premake5.lua` at v9.7.4 compiles
`external/injector/minhook/src/**.c`,
`external/injector/utility/FunctionHookMinHook.cpp`, `external/miniz/miniz.c`,
`external/MemoryModule/*.c` and `external/d3d8to9/source/*.cpp` alongside the
loader's own sources, and builds against the DirectX 9 SDK headers and import
libraries in `external/minidx9`. Redistributing it therefore redistributes
MinHook, injector, miniz, MemoryModule and d3d8to9 as well, and each has its own
section in this file. The MinHook section covers the copy inside the loader as
well as any linked into the mod itself; the licence text is the same.

### Embedded third-party DLLs removed

Compiled-in components are not the whole of it. The upstream 32-bit
`dinput8.dll` also carries three complete third-party DLLs as `RCDATA`
resources, so that a user who renames the loader over one of those libraries
still gets the original exports, plus the ini template one of them reads. Each
was identified from the export table and version resource inside the resource
itself, in the upstream asset:

| Resource | Identifies itself as | Rights holder |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| `RCDATA 101` | `vorbisfile.dll` | Xiph.Org Foundation, BSD-3-Clause |
| `RCDATA 103` | `wndmode.dll`, "DirectX Windower Embedded v2.3 (based on D3D Windower v1.88)" | (C) 2008 VEG, (C) 2004 menopem |
| `RCDATA 104` | `wndmode.ini` template for the above | as above |
| `RCDATA 105` | `binkw32.dll`, "Bink and Smacker" 1.994i | Copyright (C) 1994-2014, RAD Game Tools, Inc. |

None of the three is ours to hand on. Bink is proprietary middleware licensed
per title, and a release ZIP is a redistribution however deeply the bytes are
buried. The windower carries no licence at all. vorbisfile is redistributable
under BSD-3-Clause, but only with its notice, and we neither call it nor want
the obligation.

So the vendored copy has all four resources zeroed by
`scripts/strip-loader-payload.ps1`, which `pixi run update-deps` runs on every
refresh and which `scripts/package-release.ps1` re-runs in `-VerifyOnly` mode
before it builds either ZIP, so a loader that still carries them cannot reach a
release. Only the `.rsrc` section differs from the upstream asset: the loader's
code, data, imports, relocations and appended PDB are byte-identical, which is
what the two hashes above are for. MIT permits the modification, and it is
recorded here and in `vendor/ultimate-asi-loader/README.md` so this copy is not
mistaken for stock upstream.

Nothing in this mod could reach those resources in any case. The two library
payloads are selected by the loader's own filename, and we deploy it as
`dinput8.dll`; the windower needs a `wndmode.ini` next to the game exe, which we
never ship.

## injector

- **Version:** commit `3a384e8d1b575c09383b0fab8bd92e34cb654949`, the submodule
  Ultimate ASI Loader v9.7.4 pins at `external/injector/`
- **License:** zlib
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/ThirteenAG/injector
- **Usage:** The loader's `FunctionHookMinHook` wrapper, which the
  `Ultimate-ASI-Loader-Win32` target compiles from
  `external/injector/utility/FunctionHookMinHook.cpp`, and the MinHook submodule
  that repository carries. Nothing in this repository calls or links it; it
  ships only inside that binary.
- **Bundled:** yes. Compiled into the shipped `dinput8.dll`.

Its code inside that binary is unaltered upstream - the only change we make to
the loader is zeroing the embedded resources described above, which touches no
compiled code - so the "altered source versions" condition below does not
arise. It is reproduced whole regardless.

## miniz

- **Version:** 3.0.0, as vendored at `external/miniz/` in Ultimate ASI Loader
  v9.7.4
- **License:** MIT
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/richgel999/miniz
- **Usage:** Zip reading for the loader's `LoadVirtualFilesFromZip` path, which
  the `Ultimate-ASI-Loader-Win32` target compiles from `external/miniz/miniz.c`.
  Nothing in this repository calls or links it; it ships only inside that
  binary.
- **Bundled:** yes. Compiled into the shipped `dinput8.dll`.

## MemoryModule

- **Version:** commit `5f83e41c3a3e7c6e8284a5c1afa5a38790809461`, the submodule
  Ultimate ASI Loader v9.7.4 pins at `external/MemoryModule/`
- **License:** MPL-2.0
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/fancycode/MemoryModule
- **Usage:** Loads a DLL image from memory rather than from a file. The
  `Ultimate-ASI-Loader-Win32` target compiles it from
  `external/MemoryModule/*.c`; it is not part of the x64 build. Nothing in this
  repository calls or links it; it ships only inside that binary.
- **Bundled:** yes. Compiled into the shipped `dinput8.dll`.

**Source Code Form.** MemoryModule is licensed under the Mozilla Public License
2.0, and section 3.2 of that licence requires anyone who distributes it in
Executable Form to tell recipients how to obtain its Source Code Form. The copy
inside this `dinput8.dll` is the unmodified upstream at commit
`5f83e41c3a3e7c6e8284a5c1afa5a38790809461`, the submodule Ultimate ASI Loader
v9.7.4 pins at `external/MemoryModule/`. Its complete source is available under
that same licence from a copy itsloopyo keeps at

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

## d3d8to9

- **Version:** commit `65870f2302e9c496cd6d873d6095961d5c777668`, the submodule
  Ultimate ASI Loader v9.7.4 pins at `external/d3d8to9/`
- **License:** BSD-2-Clause
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/crosire/d3d8to9
- **Usage:** The Direct3D 8 to Direct3D 9 conversion layer behind the loader's
  `used3d8to9` ini switch, which the `Ultimate-ASI-Loader-Win32` target compiles
  from `external/d3d8to9/source/*.cpp`; it is not part of the x64 build. Nothing
  in this repository calls or links it; it ships only inside that binary.
- **Bundled:** yes. Compiled into the shipped `dinput8.dll`.

## MinHook

Source committed at `extern/minhook/`. The committed tree is the authoritative
record of exactly what is built.

- **Version:** no upstream version marker is present in the vendored tree; the copy
  under `extern/minhook/` was added in repo commit `832688e` and is authoritative
- **License:** BSD-2-Clause
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook
- **Usage:** Compiled into `SpecOpsTheLineHeadTracking.asi` and used to detour the
  game's viewpoint accessor, field of view accessor, crosshair draw and aim trace
  functions, plus Direct3D 9 `CreateDevice` and `EndScene`.
- **Bundled:** yes, as compiled object code inside the `.asi` shipped in the release
  ZIP. No separate MinHook binary is distributed.

MinHook carries two copyright holders: Tsuda Kageyu for MinHook itself, and
Vyacheslav Patkov for the Hacker Disassembler Engine that `src/hde/` is built
from. Both notices appear below exactly as upstream ships them.

This copy is modified: `MH_Initialize` uses `GetProcessHeap()` rather than
standing up a private heap with `HeapCreate`, and `MH_Uninitialize` skips the
matching `HeapDestroy`. BSD-2-Clause permits the change; it is recorded here so
the attribution is not mistaken for a claim of an unmodified copy.

## OpenTrack

- **Version:** n/a, no OpenTrack release is depended on
- **License:** ISC
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack
- **Usage:** The mod implements OpenTrack's UDP pose datagram layout so OpenTrack and
  compatible trackers can drive it.
- **Bundled:** no. Neither bundled nor linked against.

No OpenTrack code, headers or binaries are copied, linked or redistributed, so its
licence triggers no notice obligation here. It is credited because the wire format
is its work.

## Spec Ops: The Line

Spec Ops: The Line and all related names, logos, characters and marks are
trademarks of their respective owners. They are used here only to identify the
game this mod applies to, which is nominative use and not a claim of any right
in them. This project is an unofficial, fan-made modification. It is not
affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the game's developers, its
publishers, its engine vendor, or any other rights holder. It redistributes no
game code, no extracted game assets and no proprietary DLLs, and it requires a
legitimately purchased copy of the game. The clip the README embeds would be the
one piece of the game's own material this repository keeps; it is not committed
at present, and the section below covers it for when it is. Any engine
structure offsets, function addresses or byte patterns referenced in the source
were derived by the authors through independent analysis of a legitimately
owned copy. They are factual measurements recorded as numbers; no decompiled or
disassembled game code is stored in this repository.

---

## Spec Ops: The Line footage

- **File:** `assets/readme-clip.gif`, the gameplay clip the README embeds
  directly under its title. It is not committed at present, so the embed renders
  as a broken image until someone adds it; this section is the standing terms
  that clip has to be added under.
- **Rights holder:** Yager Development, who developed the game, and 2K Games,
  who published it. Any other party's marks that appear in frame stay with
  their own holders.
- **What it is for:** showing what the mod does before a reader reaches the
  first paragraph, which is how every mod page presents itself. It has to be
  ordinary gameplay recorded from a legitimately purchased copy - not a
  cutscene, not a trailer or other marketing material, and carrying no
  soundtrack. Whoever adds the file makes that true or rewrites this section to
  match what they added.
- **Where it goes:** the repository, and nowhere else. `package-release.ps1`
  copies `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`
  into the two release ZIPs and never `assets/`, so the clip ships in neither
  the installer ZIP nor the Nexus ZIP.
- **Licence:** none is granted or implied over the footage. It is reproduced to
  identify and illustrate the game this mod applies to, and it will be taken
  down on request from a rights holder.
